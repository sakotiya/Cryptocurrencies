# Cryptocurrencies

An analysis using unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm to discover unknown patterns.

The purpose of this analysis was to use data from CryptoCompare to provide a report and visualization of currently traded cryptocurrencies that can be grouped together to create a new classification system. This report would be used to help Accountability Accounting offer a new investment portfolio in the exciting world of cryptocurrency to its customers.

Since the data does not have any known outcome, we needed to preprocess it to fit an unsupervised Machine Learning model that will enable us to run a clustering algorithm that will allow us to group the cryptocurrencies.
